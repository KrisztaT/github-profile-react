# GitHub Profile Search

This React application was developed by utilising my [GitHub Profile Search](https://github.com/KrisztaT/small_projects/tree/main/github_profiles) web app which was built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Profile Search app allows users to search for and view information about GitHub users and their public repositories.

Features:

* User search: Users can enter a GitHub username to search for and view information about a particular user.
* User data display: The application displays the user's avatar, name, bio, and follower/following count, as well as the number of public repositories the user has.
* Repository list: The application also displays a list of the user's public repositories, which are clickable links to the repositories' GitHub pages.
